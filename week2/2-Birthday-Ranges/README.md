# Birthday ranges

Implement a function in [Java](BirthdayRanges.java), [Python](birthday_ranges.py)
or [C++](birthday_ranges.cpp) that given a vector of people's birthdays (numbers
in the range 0-365) and a vector of ranges (pairs of numbers in the range 0-365)
produces a vector of the number of people with birthday in the specific range.
