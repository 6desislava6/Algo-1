# Closest Coffee Store

Implement a function in [Java](ClosestCoffeeStore.java), [Python](closest_coffee_store.py)
or [C++](closest_coffee_store.cpp) that given a graph of connected points
of interests and a starting point returns the closest coffee store to that
point. Return `-1` in case there is no reachable coffee store from this location.
