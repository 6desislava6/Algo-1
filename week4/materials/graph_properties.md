# Graph properties

Here are some important properties you should know about different
types of graphs.

## Edge direction

### Undirected graph

A graph which edges have no direction. They could be interpreted as
bidirectional connections.

### Directed graph

A graph which edges have a direction. This means that if a node `a` is
related to another node `b` the reverse might not be true.

## Edge weight

### Unweighted graph

Graphs without edge weights are called unweighted. Edges of unweighted
graphs are considered equals.

### Weighted graph

Graphs with edge weights are called weighted. Edges are threated differently
in algorithms with respect to their weights.

## Number of edges

### Simple graph

Simple graphs allow single edge connecting two nodes.

### Multigraph

Multigraphs allow more than one edge to connect two nodes.

## Cycles

### Acyclic graph

Acyclic graphs are graphs that do not have cycles in paths
between any two nodes.

### Cyclic graph

Cyclic graphs are graphs that have at least one cycle in paths
between any two nodes.
